# SKR-Mini-E3-V1.2-512K-to-Play
SKR Mini E3 V1.2 firmware for Printrbot Play w/o heated Bed
This Firmware is used at your own risk.
This is for a Printrbot Play without heated Bed and has 3 point leveling for the induction probe. It has features set such as S_CURVE, LIN_ADV and ARC support.
It is set for the default size of 102mm X 102mm X 131
The SKR Mini5.stl is the one I finally used. It is a printable adapter plate from printrboard to SKR MINI. It orients the board 90degrees to the original board position. It lines the MicrSD on the board with the SD port in the Play chassis. This allowed me to use a Stock "CR10" LCD display where you need to use the onboard SD card to load files. The recommended TFT displays have USB and SD ports on them so this is not necessary to do for them. For the TFT displays you can use SKR Mini3.stl, but if you want to update firmware you will have to find a way to get to the MicroSD onboard to carry out that update. I recommend using the SKR Mini5.stl!
